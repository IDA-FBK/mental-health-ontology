# MIAO: Mental Illness Analysis Ontology

## Introduction

**MIAO (Mental Illness Analysis Ontology)** is an ontology designed to represent and model the process of analyzing and detecting mental health conditions from various data sources. It provides a structured vocabulary for describing entities, activities, annotations, and models involved in mental illness analysis, particularly in computational settings.

The ontology is built upon well-established vocabularies such as PROV-O for provenance, the Web Annotation Ontology (OA) for annotations, and the Machine Learning Schema (MLS) for ML models, ensuring interoperability and extensibility.

**Namespace URI:** `TBD`  
**Preferred Prefix:** `miao`

## Ontology Overview

MIAO revolves around a few core concepts that model the entire analysis pipeline, from the source data to the final, categorized annotation.

## Classes

| Class | Description | Cardinalities / Restrictions |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **MentalIllness** | Predicted mental illness from a model | Belongs to exactly 1 `MentalIllnessCategory` and 1 `MentalIllnessesSet` |
| **DisorderType** | Type of disorder, subclass of `MentalIllness` | Inherits restrictions of `MentalIllness` |
| **MentalIllnessCategory** | Literature-based category of mental illness | Belongs to exactly 1 `MentalIllnessesModel`, refers to exactly 1 `MentalIllness` |
| **MentalIllnessesModel** | Model/ontology defining categories | Must have ≥1 `MentalIllnessCategory`; may be used in ≥1 `MentalIllnessesAnalysis` |
| **MentalIllnessesAnalysis** | A run analyzing mental illnesses | Uses exactly 1 `MentalIllnessesModel`; generates exactly 1 `MentalIllnessesSet` |
| **MentalIllnessesSet** | Set of predicted illnesses | Contains ≥1 `MentalIllness`; generated by exactly 1 `MentalIllnessesAnalysis` |
| **Prediction** | Single model prediction | Belongs to exactly 1 `PredictionsSet` |
| **PredictionsSet** | Collection of predictions | Contains ≥1 `Prediction` |
